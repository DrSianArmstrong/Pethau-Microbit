# Pethau-Microbit
DrSian's repository of stuff for the microbit. How can I be more descriptive before I start?
No idea what I am doing here. Are you just supposed to KNOW what you are doing in Github? It is all a mystery to me.

What I have done so far...
Created a DAL project in the online mbed compiler
It compiles and runs on the microbit, producing (or now) just a square wave output on a pin at the required time interval (editable in the code when I want to alter the interval)
I tried to follow the instructions on making a package so also created a .json file, but not sure what this is.
